In this test, we aim to validate the gesture functionalities and fundamental capabilities of
Appium using the APIDemos.apk application. This test will cover the following key aspects:

1. Setup and Initialization:

· Configure the desired capabilities, including device name, platform, app package,
and app activity.
. Establish a connection to the Appium server and initialize the Appium driver.

2. Launching the Application:
. Launch the APIDemos.apk application on the Android device.
. Verify that the application opens to the main activity.

3. Testing Basic Gestures:

. Tap: Perform a tap gesture on a specific element and validate the expected
outcome.

smooth scrolling.

. Long Press: Perform a long press on an element and verify the triggered action.

4. Navigating the App:
. Use the UiScrollable class to scroll and locate elements within the app.

. Validate that elements are correctly found and actions are performed as expected.

5. Cleanup and Teardown:
. Close the application and end the Appium session.
. Clean up any resources used during the test.

Expected Outcomes:

· Successful configuration and initialization of the Appium driver.

. Correct execution of basic gestures such as tap, swipe, and long press.

. Accurate navigation and interaction with elements in the APIDemos.apk application.

. Proper cleanup and termination of the test session.

This test serves as a foundational exercise to familiarize with Appium's gesture
functionalities and establish a robust framework for future automated tests.
